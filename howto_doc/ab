Make sure apache is really running with your own command and not via service

source /etc/apache2/envvars
sudo -E ip netns exec ns_server /usr/sbin/apache2

make sure the local loopback interface for the ns_server namespace is up

sudo ip netns exec ns_server ip link set dev lo up

otherwise varnish cannot reach the apache server
